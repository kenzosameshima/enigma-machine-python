# Enigma Machine
This project is a Supervised Practical Assignment (SPA) for the *Introduction to Structured Programming* course in the Computer Science program at UNIP. It simulates the basic functionality of the historical Enigma Machine using Python.

The program allows users to input a message, which is then encrypted and decrypted using a system of configurable rotors and a reflector, emulating the core logic of the original cipher device.
